# A Tribute to the IBM PC110

## A Deep Dive into Silicon, Sandpaper, and Secrets of the IBM PC110

**Reverse engineering the beloved IBM PC110, a 486SX-based subnotebook from the 90s, released exclusively in Japan with custom repackaged BGA chips, custom ASICs, and an attractive form factor.**

## Introduction: A Palm-Sized Powerhouse

The **IBM PC110**, released exclusively in **Japan in 1995**, was one of the smallest fully functional x86 systems ever made by IBM. This palmtop computer crammed a 486SX CPU, a CHIPS 65535 VGA chip, two PCMCIA slots, a CF card, and more great features into something that fits on top of your palm.

Despite rumors of an **English-language or U.S. release**, no such version ever reached the market. The project was reportedly in development but was quietly shelved, making the IBM PC110 unique and **regionally rare and historically mysterious**.

What fascinated me wasn’t just the size—it was the story under the keyboard: repackaged BGA packages and chips with no public documentation, the usage of camcorder batteries instead of a proprietary battery, and a CF card slot which made the machine sort of future proof and relevant to be "practical", even today. 

Ufortuantely, most of the IBM PC110s 

So I decided to **reverse engineer the entire machine**. That journey involved **sandpaper**, **ROM dumps**, **laser decapping**, **high-resolution die photos**, and the help of some brilliant hardware hackers. What I found includes rare chipsets, custom logic arrays, and design decisions that were both *visionary* and *tragically destructive*.

## A Design Ahead of Its Time and One Fatal Flaw

The PC110 had forward-thinking design features, including:

- A **standard camcorder battery** (still sold on Amazon today)
- A **CompactFlash card slot**, used as its primary storage drive

These were remarkable decisions in 1995, long before CF replaced spinning disks in industrial systems.

But the system had a fatal flaw:  
A small **NiMH-based bridge battery**, placed internally, designed to maintain power between main battery swaps.

Over time, that battery becomes a **ticking time bomb**.  
As it fails, it **leaks potassium hydroxide (KOH)**, a highly corrosive chemical that **destroys PCB traces**, **eats through components**, and **wrecks solder joints**.  
It’s the leading cause of death for otherwise restorable PC110 units today.

## Sanding a 10-Layer PCB — With a Flatbed Scanner

To begin understanding the system, I took the hard and destructive, yet necessary route:  
I **sanded the motherboard** down layer by layer.

The board is just **1.0mm thick**, with **10 copper layers**, each ~**70 microns**. I used **ultra-fine grit sandpaper** to remove layers delicately, scanning the exposed surface after each pass with a **high-resolution flatbed scanner**.

It was slow, imperfect, and occasionally damaging—but it worked. By the end, I had a full stack of perfectly aligned copper layers. Because I made several mistakes during the sanding and went too far, especially as I progressed through the layers, I had to sacrifice a second PCB, this time by sanding it from the other side.

---

## Reconstructing the Board in KiCad

With the scanned layers imported into **KiCad**, I aligned them and manually traced:

- Every net  
- Every via (through and blind)  
- Every component pad  
- Every trace/track  
- Every power polygon  
- Many more details  

Bit by bit, the **entire circuit** came together. I gave up many times in the middle due to some complexity or unresolved issues, but each time, I returned and continued. Some traces were incomplete or degraded, but logic and redundancy allowed me to **reconstruct the full schematic** of the system. Some tracks even appeared to go nowhere—perhaps used for debugging or cut later by the manufacturer. Who knows what software IBM used in the mid-90s; certainly not KiCad.

## Schematic Extraction and Deep System Insight

After the layout was reconstructed and the parts were identified, I began to **extract the schematic**, piece by piece.  
I organized different **subsystems** into separate schematic sheets, including:

- Clock Tree  
- CPU and debug port  
- Chipset and RTC  
- VGA controller  
- RAM interface  
- ROM and BIOS  
- ASICs  
- Super IO (FDD, Serial, LPT)  
- Power and charging logic  
- PCMCIA controller  
- Audio and FM Synthesizer  
- Storage and CF slot  
- Keyboard/PS2  
- IRDA and Docking station connector  

This gave me exceptional insight into **how IBM and RIOS Systems engineered this device**. After extracting the full schematic, I linked it back to the layout to identify and resolve discrepancies.  

The result is a schematic that **perfectly reflects the physical PCB** — signal-for-signal.

## Why This Schematic Unlocks the Future

With a fully accurate schematic and layout, this project now enables:

- **Redesigning the motherboard** with modern components  
- **Changing the form factor** entirely (e.g., vertical/landscape designs)  
- **Creating a Raspberry Pi-based recreation**  
- **Hardware diagnostics and repair**  
- **Upgrades and mods**, including custom RAM cards, new docks, and embedded devices

## The Known and Unknown Silicon

Identified components:

- **Intel 80486SX** CPU  
- **CHIPS65535** VGA controller  
- **Ricoh RB5C396** PCMCIA bridge  
- **FDC37C665IR** for FDD, Serial, LPT  
- **SC414281PU4** Storage Controller  
- Various logic ICs

Mysterious components:

- **VL82C420** – part of the SCAMP IV chipset, no datasheet available  
- **ES488** – no datasheet found; reverse-engineered from ISA sound card  
- **IBM “Pluto” and “Bowman” ASICs**

The VL82C420 integrates 6 known chips (VL82C59s, VL82C37s, VL82C54, VL82C018) and a custom gate array.

## Decapping Chips with CLC and John McMaster

With Fred Nielsen from **CLC**, we decapped the VL82C420, Pluto, and Bowman using a laser-driven photo-chemical process.  
**John McMaster** provided high-resolution die imaging.

### Inside the VL82C420

- 2× VL82C37 (DMA Controller)  
- 1× VL82C54 (Timer)  
- 1× VL82C018 (RTC)  
- Integrated gate array  
- BGA packaging custom-made by RIOS

### Pluto and Bowman

IBM-designed gate arrays responsible for:

- Power sequencing
